Welcome to *Elasticsearch Queries in 15 Minutes*.
In this module you will learn how to write and execute queries in
Elasticsearch.
This module  is designed to *introduce* you to the Elasticsearch query DSL and
to demonstrate how you can use Elasticsearch to query your data.

Due to time constraints, this course is an *introduction* to the Elasticsearch
query DSL, which is vast and can be quite complex.
Also, even though this module contains code that downloads, starts, and loads
data into Elasticsearch, this is not the focus of this course.

Hi everyone, my name is Pablo and today I am going to walk you through
Elasticsearch queries in 15 minutes.

In this module you'll learn how to write and execute queries in Elasticsearch.
This module is designed to *introduce* you to the Elasticsearch query DSL and
to demonstrate how you can use Elasticsearch to query your data.

This module is divided in four lessons:

First, "Setup Elasticsearch and Kibana".
In this lesson you will quickly recap how to get started with the Elastic
Stack.

The second lesson is "Introduction to Query DSL", in which you will better
understand the `_search` endpoint and get started with queries.

Next, you will learn about "Match" and "Boolean" queries, the bread and
butter of Elasticsearch queries.

Finally, in the "Next Steps" lesson, you will see some more advanced and
interesting queries that you might want to learn.

Are you ready? Next, you will setup Elasticsearch and Kibana.
