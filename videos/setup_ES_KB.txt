To run Elasticsearch, all you need to do is:
- download the binary
- extract the package
- and execute it
Then, you can check if Elasticsearch is up and running.

There are multiple ways to load data into Elasticsearch.
Using the "curl" command and the "_bulk" API you can load all documents
from a file with the "bulk" format.
Then, you can use a "count" to check the number of total documents.

Finally, to run Kibana, all you need to do is download the binary, extract
the package and execute it.
Because you want to access Kibana from all external computers, you should bind
it to "0.0.0.0".
This will setup Kibana to listen to all IP addresses on the local machine.

All set, Elasticsearch and Kibana running and the  dataset is loaded.
