Welcome to Elasticsearch Queries in 15 minutes.
In this module you'll learn how to write and execute queries in Elasticsearch.
This module  is designed to *introduce* you to the Elasticsearch query DSL and
to demonstrate how you can use Elasticsearch to query your data.

Due to time constraints, this course is an *introduction* to the Elasticsearch
query DSL, which is vast and can be quite complex.
Also, even though this module contains code that downloads, starts, and load
data into Elasticsearch, this is not the focus of this course.
