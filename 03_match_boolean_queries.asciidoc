The match query and the boolean query are the bread and butter of
Elasticsearch queries.
Watch the video below to better understand how they work and to learn how
to write your own queries.

Next, go to your lab tab to improve your knowledge about the `match` and
`bool` queries.

* this is more of a live demo style video than a recorded script
* the following should be used as a guide

The `match` query is one of the main queries in Elasticsearch.
It can be used to find documents that contain one or more terms in a field.
For example, imagine you want to find all recipes that contain `banana`.
You should start writing a get request to the `recipes` index and the
`_search` endpoint.
Then you can type `query` and use the auto-completion.
Inside the `query` object you can start typing `match` and again use
the auto-completion.
Now, you should define the "field", which is "ingredients" and the "term",
which is "banana".
There are 87 recipes that contain banana.

Maybe you also like `cinnamon` and want to add it to the search terms.
Now, instead of 87 you get back 2618 documents.
Probably not what you expected.
The reason for that is that by default the match query uses an OR as the
operator.
You can rewrite the `match` query using the full format and define the
AND operator instead. Now, only 13 recipes are returned.

Imagine you are looking for a Brazilian dessert.
How would you update the query to reflect that?

In Elasticsearch, you can use the Boolean query.
It allows you to combine multiple clauses using boolean logic.
There are four main constructs in the bool query: must, must_not, should,
and filter.
To answer the questions we need to use a must clause and add the existing
match clause along with a new match clause for the Brazilian cuisine.

Maybe you want the opposite, recipes that are not from Brazil.
In this case, the match clause for banana and cinnamon stays inside the must
and the match clause for the Brazilian cuisine goes into a must_not.
